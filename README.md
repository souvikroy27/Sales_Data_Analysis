## Conclusion
Pizza orders and revenue maintains an upward trajectory from the beginning of the week Sunday and peaks on Friday before it starts dropping, this means most people prefer to eat pizza towards and during the weekend. Most people prefer to have the Pepperoni pizza for lunch on Fridays. It is advisable to make available tables and chairs to be able to accomodate the influx of the weekend, we can also explore the option of delivery services. The Ingrdients for Pepperoni pizza should be made readily available and in large quantities on or before Fridays. Since more orders are received on Fridays, a discount policy can be introduced every last Friday of the month where a customer gets 1 extra pizza when they buy 3 and above, this will encourage them to buy more.

## Insights from above project
The outlet should capitalize on Large size Classic, Supreme, Veggie and Chicken pizzas.

Since XL and XXL pizzas account for such a small percentage of their sales (just 1.94%), they can safely get rid of these pizza sizes.

Even though the Brie Carre pizza is the worst seller, it recorded 490 pizzas sold. It would still be a good idea to keep it in the menu.
